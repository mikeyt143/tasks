MyTasks Pro - Privacy Policy

1) Data collection
- The app does not upload tasks to external servers unless you explicitly enable a sync account (CalDAV, Google Tasks, etc.).
- If you enable sync, data will be sent to the configured provider and is subject to that provider's privacy policy.
- If ads are enabled, the ads SDK may collect device identifiers and other telemetry as described by the ad provider.

2) Ads and third parties
- Third-party ad SDKs (for example AdMob) may collect device identifiers, advertising IDs, and usage data.
- We do not control ad network data collection; see the ad network's privacy policy for details.

3) Data safety
- Local data is stored on the device.
- Users can export and backup their tasks locally.

4) Contact
- For privacy questions, contact: mikeyt143@example.com
